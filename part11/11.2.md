## 11.1 Warming up

1. Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked? You can search for the answers by Google.
2. What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? Again, you can ask Google!
3. Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

Answers:
1. For linting, we can use ESLint. For testing, we can use Jest. For building, we can use Webpack or Turbopack. 
2. Some alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions are GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and Azure DevOps.
3. Depends on the project. If the project is small, it would be better to use a cloud-based environment. If the project is large, it would be better to use a self-hosted environment. We would need to know the budget and the resources needed to make the decision.
